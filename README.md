**BY FOUAD HERE's the datasets link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/2yy5yw7zo7l9mly/Datasets.zip/file **

📌 Description:


Fraudulent transactions cost businesses both money and customer trust. This project develops an ML-based fraud detection tool that uses historical transaction data to predict whether new activities are fraudulent or legitimate. A lightweight frontend allows users to test new samples and get instant fraud-risk predictions.


🚀 Features:


Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning model for fraud classification
Real-time prediction support
Simple frontend for testing new inputs


🛠️ Technologies Used:


Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Frontend (basic UI framework)
