🛡️ Fraud Detection System
📌 Description
Fraudulent transactions cost businesses both money and customer trust. This project develops an ML-based fraud detection tool that uses historical transaction data to predict whether new activities are fraudulent or legitimate. A lightweight frontend allows users to test new samples and get instant fraud-risk predictions.
🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning model for fraud classification
Real-time prediction support
Simple frontend for testing new inputs
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Frontend (basic UI framework)
